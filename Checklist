Things to get done before the deadline:
(when you finish one just erase it from here)

Arduino
- Debug the code for launching the serial connection
- Add in server-side functions to
  - Ask for temperature
  - Set stove on/off
  - Ask for overflow status
- and functions to handle the return (add it to a struct to then send back as packet)


Video
- Record each feature of the arduino project
- Compile all together into one video

And other things to check for
- Server needs to handle HTML status codes 200 (successful request), 404 (Not Found), and 501(Not Implemented).
- Submit all files in a directory called a3
- Make a readme file to describe everything especially the physical computing part and include links to external resources
- Error checking
  - Make sure the user can only input the correct name=value pairs
  - Make sure each command has the exact number of name=value pairs needed
